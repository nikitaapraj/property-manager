# Get started

## System requirements

* [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
* The [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) app. The Real Estate Real Data API service runs on your development system with an `http://localhost` hostname. Therefore, the service doesn't work with the web-version of Postman.
